\section{Introduction}
\FloatBarrier

The recorded TDC values (in nanoseconds) which provide the measurement of drift times for the ions produced by a charged particle passing through the drift chamber are actually a sum of the true drift time and several delays. One major component of this delay is the delay due to the time taken by the signals while traveling through the signal cables.


\section{Procedure for \t0 estimation}
To dermine the $T_0$ for a given cable, a histogram is made of the TDC values recorded for all the hits corresponding to the cable. Then towards the rising edge, the histogram is fit to the following function with five free parameters $p_0$, .., $p_4$.



%\begin{comment}
\begin{equation}
    \label{T0fit}
    f(t) = e^{p_0 + p_1t} \frac{1}{1 + e^{p_2 + p_3t}}  + p_4
    % f(t) = exp*sigmoid + constant
    %   exp: decaying behaviour after the rising edge
    % sigmoid: for the S-shape of the signal
    % constant: for the noise in data for some cables.
\end{equation}
%\end{comment}



\subsection{Constraints on the fit parameters}
To get reasonable looking fits, the free parameters had to be constrained to values as listed in
the table \ref{tabParLimits}. The resons for those constraints are explained in corresponding 
sections below.

\subsubsection{Constraining par[1]}
To avoid cases such as in the 5th and 6th plot in figure \ref{tdcPosExp} % https://www.jlab.org/Hall-B//secure/eg4/adhikari/PDWK/CLAS12/BkUp/tdcForRun085_Cables19to24.gif 
(where the exp in the numerator rises rather than decays because par[1] is determined to be positive), 
we ask Minuit to constrain this parameter to be negative (within -1.0 and -4.0e-03), which is decided by looking 
at par[1] values for cases where it had already worked (such as in the first 4 plots in the same figure above). 
Initially, a very large range was given and that made it go bersek. Later, the range (-1.0,0.0) was tried but that 
still left one plot looking unusual such as the fourth plot in figure \ref{tdcSharp}.

%http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/39147/scale-image-to-page-width
%Use \textwidth for the width of the text block, and \paperwidth if you want to fit it into the paper width. You could also use \linewidth if you want to fit the image within the line width, which may vary depending on the environment you're in (for example, within a list like enumerate).

    \caption{Time distributions showing fits when par[1] wasn't constrained well.}
    \label{tdcSharp}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Constraining par[4]}
And, without a limit on par[4] for the constant noise, sometimes it went negative (as big 
as 1480 - such as for 81st cable in figure \ref{tdcNegNoise}.
%in this set https://www.jlab.org/Hall-B//secure/eg4/adhikari/PDWK/CLAS12/BkUp/tdcForRun068_Cables79to84.gif . 
To avoid that situation, the parameter was allowed to vary only above zero and within [0.0,1.0e06].

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{Figures/tdcForRun068_Cables79to84.png}
    \caption{Time distributions showing fits when par[4] wasn't constrained well.}
    \label{tdcNegNoise}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Constraining par[2] and par[3]}

Next the cable 52 showed a little abnormal fit as seen in figure \ref{tdcSharp2}
%in https://www.jlab.org/Hall-B//secure/eg4/adhikari/PDWK/CLAS12/BkUp/tdcForRun068_Cables49to54.gif . 
When checked the values of the fit parameters, the value of par[2] was seen to be 1.82085e+04,
whereas in other cables, it was of the order of 3.0e+2. So, it was imperative to put 
limits on its value, which was chosen to be [100.0,4.0e02]. With that limit, the issue
was resolved, but it created a new problem in Cable 8 as reflected in figure \ref{tdcFlatFit}
%(https://www.jlab.org/Hall-B//secure/eg4/adhikari/PDWK/CLAS12/BkUp/tdcForRun068_Cables07to12.gif).
When checked again, it was that it had gotten  par[1]=-3.50957e-06 and par[2]=2.18599e+01. 
In other working cases, these values were of the order of -7.00443e-03 and 3.19779e+02, so 
the upper limit of par[1] above was changed from 0 to -1.0e-04. This made it better but 
still not quite as good as we wanted. Upon checking parameters again, it was seen that par[3] 
was of the order of -4.26634e-02 and par[2] of the order 3.80025e+01, whereas in the working case 
they were of order 2.83977e+02 and  -3.18337e-01. Therefore, par[2], and par[3] were also 
constrained within [100.0,4.0e02] and [-1.0,-1.0e-01] respectively.

    \caption{Time distributions showing fits when par[2] wasn't constrained well.}
    \label{tdcFlatFit}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Constraining par[0]}
Finally, to avoid getting cases such as that for cable 81 in figure \ref{tdcNoSigm}, 
%//https://www.jlab.org/Hall-B//secure/eg4/adhikari/PDWK/CLAS12/BkUp/tdcForRun068_Cables79to84nw0.gif
in which case par[0] was negative i.e, -1.09872e+01, the par[0] was also constrained inside [8.6,13.2].

    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{Figures/tdcForRun068_Cables79to84nw0.png}
    \caption{Time distributions showing fits when par[0] wasn't constrained well.}
    \label{tdcNoSigm}
\end{figure}




\subsection{Estimating T0 values from the fits}

Once the overall fit is obtained, corresponding T0 can be extracted from its fit parameters. From the fit
fit parameters, we can extract the straight line that represents the leading edge and if this straight line
is extrapolated down to the horizontal line that represents the constant noise level (given by the fifth
fit parameter p4), time value corresponding to the intersection point gives us the T0 for the given
distribution. The straight line representing the rising edge can be defined as the line that passes through the
central (half-way) point $P_{1/2}$ of the corresponding sigmoid and having the same slope $m$ as the
fit function at that particular reference point.

The reference point $P_{1/2}$ is the one on the fit function where the x-value (or time here) is such that the corresponding
sigmoid function i.e. $1.0/(1+e^{p_2 + p_3 x})$ would have the value of $1/2$. This is true when the exponential term in
the denominator would be exactly one, which means the x-coordinate of that point is given by:
\begin{equation}
\label{xSigHalf}
\begin{aligned}
     x_{1/2} = xSigm_{1/2} = - \frac{p_2}{p_3}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The slope of the fit function at $x = x_{1/2}$, on the other hand, is given by its derivative at that point as
follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{slopeSigHalf}
\begin{aligned}
  slope = m  =  e^{p_0 + p_1 x} \Big( \frac{p_1}{1 + e^{p_2 + p_3 x}} -   \frac{p_3 e^{p_2 + p_3 x}}{(1 + e^{p_2 + p_3 x})^2}    \Big)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The value of the function at $x = x_{1/2}$ point is easily evaluated by calling the 'evaluate()' method of the
function class that is used for the fitting procedure. Now, using the \textbf{point-slope} form for the equation of
a straight line, the line representing the leading edge is given by the following equation:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqLeadingEdge}
\begin{aligned}
  y - f(x_{1/2}) = slope (x - x_{1/2})
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Likewise, the equation for the noise level is as follows:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqNoiseLevel}
\begin{aligned}
  y = p_4
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Now solving these two equations for x gives the T0 defined by the intersection point as follows:

\begin{equation}
\label{T0estm1}
\begin{aligned}
%//X value where the st. line meets the noise background (background = fPars[4] (Extrapolation upto noise level)
  T0   & =  \frac{p_4 - f(x_{1/2})}{slope} + x_{1/2} \\
%       & =  - \frac{1 + e^{p_2 + p_3 x_{1/2}}}{p_1 + (p_1 - p_3) e^{p_2 + p_3 x_{1/2}}} - \frac{p_2}{p_3}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

By using equations \ref{T0fit}, \ref{xSigHalf}, and \ref{slopeSigHalf} into \ref{T0estm1}, the expression for T0 can be simplified further, giving
the following expression for T0:
\begin{equation}
\label{T0estm2}
\begin{aligned}
  T0   & = - \frac{1 + e^{p_2 + p_3 x_{1/2}}}{p_1 + (p_1 - p_3) e^{p_2 + p_3 x_{1/2}}} - \frac{p_2}{p_3}\\
       & = - \frac{2}{2p_1  - p_3} - \frac{p_2}{p_3}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}


The second method is extrapolating the same straight line further down such that the corresponding value of
time where it meets the time-axis gives us the T0 estimate as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{T0estm2n}
\begin{aligned}
%//X value where the st. line meets the X or time axis (Extrapolation upto  y=0 level i.e upto X or time axis)
   T0  =    &  sigmoidHalfwayPoint + \\
            & \frac{1}{derivSigHalfPoint} (0.0 - funcValAtSigHalf);
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\section{Procedure for \tmax estimation}
To dermine the \tmax for a given cable, a histogram is made of the TDC values recorded for all the hits corresponding to the cable. Then towards the falling edge, the histogram is fit to the following function with five free parameters $p_0$, .., $p_4$.

%\begin{comment}
\begin{equation}
    \label{T0fit}
    f(t) = e^{p_0 + p_1t} (1 - \frac{1}{1 + e^{p_2 + p_3t}})  + p_4
    % f(t) = exp*sigmoid + constant
    %   exp: decaying behaviour after the rising edge
    % sigmoid: for the S-shape of the signal
    % constant: for the noise in data for some cables.
\end{equation}
%\end{comment}

where $(1 - \frac{1}{1 + e^{p_2 + p_3t}})$ can be called as the inverse-sigmoid.


\subsection{Parameter Constraints}



\subsection{Estimation of \tmax}

When the values of the parameters are determined by the fits, the corresponding inverse-sigmoids 
can be extracted, from which a straight line fit to the falling edge at its half-way point ($sigmoidHalfwayPoint$)
can be determined. By extrapolating this straigh line, \tmax can be determined.

Here, $sigmoidHalfwayPoint = |par[2]/par[3]|$ (modulus is for the fact that the ratio is 
$par[2]/par[3]$ negative due to par[3] being constrained to negative values (see 
table \ref{tabParLimits}).

\section{Propagation Of Uncertainties from fit parameters $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$ to T0}
From equation \ref{T0estm2}, we see that T0 depends on three different parameters $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$. And, if these parameters have
uncertainties $\Delta p_1$, $\Delta p_2$, and $\Delta p_3$ respectively, they will all propagate\cite{wikiErrProp} and contribute to the overall uncertainty in T0 as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{apT0err}
\begin{aligned}
  \Delta T0    =  - \sqrt{\Big(\frac{\partial T0}{\partial p_1} \Big)^2 (\Delta p_1)^2
    +  \Big(\frac{\partial T0}{\partial p_2} \Big)^2 (\Delta p_2)^2
    +  \Big(\frac{\partial T0}{\partial p_3} \Big)^2 (\Delta p_3)^2}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Now, these partial derivatives of T0 w.r.t the three parameters are evaluated as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{dT0BydP123}
\begin{aligned}
  \frac{\partial T0}{\partial p_1} & =  \frac{4}{  (2p_1 - p_3)^2}  \\
  \frac{\partial T0}{\partial p_2} & =  -\frac{ 1}{ p_3} \\
  \frac{\partial T0}{\partial p_3} & =  -\frac{ 2}{ (2p_1 - p_3)^2} + \frac{ p_2}{ p^2_3}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
